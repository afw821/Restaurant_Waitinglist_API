Hot Restaurant Application

  This application uses a basic front end interface via Bootstrap. The user can navigate to the reservation page and enter their information where it will be displayed on the reservation table. If there are more than five reservations then the user's information will be displayed on the waiting list table.

Getting Started

  You can run this application using your local host but I reccomend following this deployment link to Heroku https://radiant-cove-79593.herokuapp.com/

Prerequisites

The dependencies are as follows:

"dependencies": {

 "express": "^4.16.4",
 
 "path": "^0.12.7"
 
}

If you use the above Heroku link there is no need to install these dependencies.

Using the Site

  There are clearly marked buttons to navigate you to the home page, reservation page and the table page. There are two likns at the bottom of the home page and reservation page which will display the respective API with the user's information.

The user can enter the last name of a current or former MLB baseball player and it will render a card with some general information. The search team function is currently under construction. The login feature isn't fully functional. If there are issues the user can bypass this by using the html route /search.

Built With:

*Express.js *Node.js *HTML5 *CSS3 *JavaScript *jQuery *Bootstrap
